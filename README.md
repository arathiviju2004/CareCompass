## Overview

The Home Nurse Finder is a web-based application designed to connect individuals with nursing professionals for at-home care services. Leveraging a simple yet powerful interface, users can search for nurses based on location and specialization, ensuring they find the right care provider for their needs.

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating a practical application of these technologies in creating user-friendly web applications. Data about nurses, including their specialization and location, is stored in a JSON file, simulating a backend database.

## Features

- **Simple Search Interface:** Users can easily search for nurses by location and specialization through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on devices of all sizes.
- **Dynamic Data Retrieval:** Nurse information is dynamically retrieved from a JSON file, mimicking the process of fetching data from a server.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structures the web application's content.
- **CSS:** Styles the application to be visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript:** Powers the application's interactivity, enabling dynamic data retrieval and search functionality.
- **JSON:** Simulates a database for storing and accessing nurse information.

## How It Works

1. **Data Structure:** Nurses' information is stored in a JSON file, which includes details such as name, location, age, and specialization.
2. **Searching:** Users input their desired location and specialization. The application then filters the JSON data accordingly.
3. **Display Results:** The filtered results are dynamically displayed on the page, allowing users to browse through available nurses.
